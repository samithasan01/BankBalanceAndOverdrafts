# Bank Balance and Overdrafts
This project keeps track of the total balance of a bank account and updates said balance after factoring in money deducted by the user. The program allows a 
certain extent of money of be overdrafted before alerting the user that the limit has been exceeded. This program also tracks whether an account is active or if it's been closed.
